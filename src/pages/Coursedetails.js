        <p> <h1>HTML</h1>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br>
        </br> It is used to design web pages using a<br>
        </br> markup language. HTML is a combination of<br>
        </br> Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext <br>
        </br>defines the link between web pages. <br>
        </br>A markup language is used to define the text <br>
        </br>document within the tag which defines the<br>
        </br> structure of web pages. This language is used<br>
        </br> to annotate (make notes for the computer) <br>
        </br>text so that a machine can understand it and<br>
        </br> manipulate text accordingly. Most markup<br>
        </br> languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. <br>
        
        </br>manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>

            Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS,<br>
            </br> is a simply designed language intended to<br>
            </br> simplify the process of making web pages presentable.<br>
            </br> CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages.<br>
            </br> More importantly, CSS enables you to do this<br>
            </br> independently of the HTML that makes up each <br>
            </br>web page. It describes how a webpage should look:<br>
            </br> it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, <br>
            </br>and much more. In short, you can make your<br>
            </br> website look however you want. CSS lets developers<br>
            </br> and designers define how it behaves,<br>
            </br> including how elements are positioned in the browser.

            ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library <br>
            </br>used to create user interfaces in a declarative<br>
            </br> and efficient way. It is a component-based<br>
            </br> front-end library responsible only for <br>
            </br>the view layer of a Model View Controller(MVC) <br>
            </br>architecture. React is used to create <br>
            </br>modular user interfaces and promotes the <br>
            </br>development of reusable UI components<br>
            </br> that display dynamic data.
